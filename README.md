This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: passing an incorrect argument type to a function. The `bug.ts` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ts` provides a corrected version. The error arises from attempting to pass an array to a function that expects a string.  The solution uses type checking and conditional logic to handle different input types. This example highlights the importance of robust type handling in TypeScript to prevent runtime errors.
